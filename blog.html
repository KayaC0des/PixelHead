                <p>Stray is quietly one of the hottest games of the year, with a lot of excitement building for this futuristic feline adventure. 
                  Turns out people like the idea of playing as a cute little cat, and a mysterious cyberpunk dystopia to explore doesn't hurt either. 
                  While the digital release arrives on 19th July — and joins PS Plus Extra day one — an alternative option will soon be available.
      
                  A physical edition of Stray is now up for pre-order over on iam8bit. This fancy version of Annapurna 
                  Interactive's cat-'em-up comes with a handful of extras, so fans will want to take a look. 
                  The game disc comes in a regular box but with a card sleeve featuring a holographic, er, graphic. 
                  Then there's a big poster you can put on your wall, six art cards, and a "Fuzzy Pettable Chenille Patch".
                  You can get this edition for either PS5 or PS4, and it'll set you back $44.99. 
                  Shipments are planned for Q4 2022, so if you can wait a few extra months, you'll get a swanky boxed copy.
                  Additionally, the soundtrack will be available on vinyl, and this is also up for pre-order.
                  For those in Europe, standard edition physical pre-orders are already starting to appear at well-known retailers:</p>

                  <p>God of War: Ragnarok is the highly-anticipated sequel to 2018's God of War and it's coming to PS4 and PS5 this year. 
        
                    Marking the final chapter of the series' Norse storyline, God of War: Ragnarok will take place a few years after the events of God of War (2018). 
                    It's here we see Kratos and a now teenage Atreus fighting for survival as Ragnarok (the end of the world) unfolds. 
                    
                    Since the game's announcement back in September 2020, we haven't been absolutely inundated with details about the next God of War game. 
                    However, a trailer released in September 2021 did give us an exciting look at gameplay and in-game cinematics. 
                  
                    God of War: Ragnarok launches on November 9, 2022 on PS5 and PS4, following a delay from its initial 2021 release window.
        
                    Before this update from PlayStation Blog, Ragnarok had been the subject of much  speculation (opens in new tab). 
                    PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst then confirmed the delay in a PlayStation Blog interview in June 2021, 
                    stating that the sequel was being pushed into 2022 to give the team at Sony Santa Monica more time following disruption caused by the pandemic.
                    
                    Following this, many later believed God of War: Ragnarok had been pushed back into 2023 too, but the June 2022 update thankfully revealed otherwise. 
                    Assuming there's no last minute delays, the launch is finally in sight for this much anticipated sequel.</p>

                        <p>Hollow Knight's sequel is on its way to Switch, XBox & PC soon.
                          Hollow Knight: Silksong is the sequel to Hollow Knight that we've been waiting four years for. 
                          We've seen bits and pieces of the game since its announcement in 2019, and although we've been graced with a fresh trailer, 
                          still haven't had any hard details on when it's coming out.
                          <br>
                          Originally planned as DLC, Silksong follows up the first game with a shift in perspective and an upward journey through the kingdom of Pharloom. 
                          We'll learn more about the dreary world through the eyes of Hornet, the new playable character, and get access to a bunch of new tools to work our 
                          way to the top of the kingdom.

                          Team Cherry has been tight-lipped about the game for the last few years, but that hasn't stopped fans from obsessing over every detail that's available. 
                          Hollow Knight introduced a rich world that people want to pick apart. Hopefully we'll learn more about it soon.

                          Hollow Knight: Silksong doesn't currently have a release date. That said, when it appeared at the Xbox & Bethesda showcase in June 2022, 
                          Xbox made a point of saying it was focused on games coming within the next 12 months. 

                          In case that wasn't proof enough, here's Xbox confirming that it meant what it said.
